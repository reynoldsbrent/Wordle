# Wordle Game

Welcome to the Wordle game! You have 6 attempts to guess the correct 5 letter word. Here's how the feedback works:
- 'X' indicates that a letter is in the correct spot.
- 'O' indicates that a letter is in the word but not in the correct spot.
- '_' indicates that a letter is not in the word.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. You will be prompted to enter a guess. Enter your guess.
3. If your guess is not a real word, you'll be asked to enter a valid guess.
4. The program will provide feedback on your guess using 'X', 'O', and '_'.
5. Keep guessing and receiving feedback until you've used all your attempts or guessed the word correctly.
6. If you guess the word correctly within 6 attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose.
